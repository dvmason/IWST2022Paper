abstract = {Dynamic mixin is a construct available in Ruby and other dynamic languages. It can be used as a base to implement a range of programming paradigms, such as dynamic aspect-oriented programming and context-oriented programming. However, the performance characteristics of current implementation of dynamic mixin in Ruby leaves much to be desired under condition of frequent dynamic mixin operations, global method cache and inline cache misses incur significant overhead. In this work we implemented fine-grained state tracking for CRuby 1. and were able to improve performance by more than six times on the microbenchmark exercising extreme case flowing 4 times to global method cache clearing, 28\% to fine-grained state tracking and further 12\% to inline cache miss elimination by caching alternating states. We demonstrated a small application using dynamic mixins that gets 48\% improvement in performance from our techniques. We also implemented in C a more general delegation object models and proposed an algorithm of thread-local caching, which allows to reduce inline cache misses while permitting thread-local delegation changes.},

These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually. A new implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete (object code) compatibility with existing implementations. This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages. The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.},

Although we are faced with new challenges posed by enormous advances in hardware and internet technology, we continue to struggle with old-fashioned languages based on rigid, static, closed-world file-based views of programming. We argue the need for a new class of dynamic languages that support a view of programming as constant evolution of living and open software models. Such languages would require features such as dynamic first-class namespaces, explicit meta-models, optional, pluggable type systems, and incremental compilation of running software systems.",

pages="51--74",
abstract="After two decades of effort, type inference for dynamically typed languages scales to programs of a few tens of thousands of lines of code, but no further. For larger programs, this paper proposes using a kind of demand-driven analysis where the number of active goals is carefully restricted. To achieve this restriction, the algorithm occasionally prunes goals by giving them solutions that are trivially true and thus require no further subgoals to be solved; the previous subgoals of a newly pruned goal may often be discarded from consideration, reducing the total number of active goals. A specific algorithm DDP is described which uses this approach. An experiment on DDP shows that it infers precise types for roughly 30{\%} to 45{\%} of the variables in a program with hundreds of thousands of lines; the percentage varies with the choice of pruning threshold, a parameter of the algorithm. The time required varies from an average of one-tenth of one second per variable to an unknown maximum, again depending on the pruning threshold. These data suggest that 50 and 2000 are both good choices of pruning threshold, depending on whether speed or precision is more important.",

        abstract={The languages discussed in this special issue have a long history, which is perhaps why some have had several different names over the years. One such language is Lisp, the second-oldest programming language. For years, many somewhat dismissively described languages such as Lisp as "scripting languages." Today, we more commonly refer to them as dynamically typed languages, typified by Python and Ruby, and their impact is arguably greater than ever. This issue highlights the practical uses of such languages and shows how they're frequently a vehicle for innovation in the development sphere. This article is part of a special issue on dynamically typed languages.},

abstract = {OpenSmalltalk-VM is a virtual machine (VM) for languages in the Smalltalk family (e.g. Squeak, Pharo) which is itself written in a subset of Smalltalk that can easily be translated to C. Development is done in Smalltalk, an activity we call “Simulation”. The production VM is derived by translating the core VM code to C. As a result, two execution models coexist: simulation, where the Smalltalk code is executed on top of a Smalltalk VM, and production, where the same code is compiled to an executable through a C compiler. In this paper, we detail the VM simulation infrastructure and we report our experience developing and debugging the garbage collector and the just-in-time compiler (JIT) within it. Then, we discuss how we use the simulation infrastructure to perform analysis on the runtime, directing some design decisions we have made to tune VM performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents a personal view of the evolution of six generations of Smalltalk in which the author played a part, starting with Smalltalk-72 and progressing through Smalltalk-80 to Squeak and Etoys. It describes the forces that brought each generation into existence, the technical innovations that characterized it, and the growth in understanding of object-orientation and personal computing that emerged. It summarizes what that generation achieved and how it affected the future, both within the evolving group of developers and users, and in the outside world.  The early Smalltalks were not widely accessible because they ran only on proprietary Xerox hardware; because of this, few people have experience with these important historical artifacts. To make them accessible, the paper provides links to live simulations that can be run in present-day web browsers. These simulations offer the ability to run pre-defined scripts, but also allow the user to go off-script, browse the details of the implementation, and try anything that could be done in the original system. An appendix includes anecdotal and technical aspects of how examples of each generation of Smalltalk were recovered, and how order was teased out of chaos to the point that these old systems could be brought back to life.},

abstract = {Dynamically-typed object-oriented languages please programmers, but their lack of static type information penalizes performance. Our new implementation techniques extract static type information from declaration-free programs. Our system compiles several copies of a given procedure, each customized for one receiver type, so that the type of the receiver is bound at compile time. The compiler predicts types that are statically unknown but likely, and inserts run-time type tests to verify its predictions. It splits calls, compiling a copy on each control path, optimized to the specific types on that path. Coupling these new techniques with compile-time message lookup, aggressive procedure inlining, and traditional optimizations has doubled the performance of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages.},
